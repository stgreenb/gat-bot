# gat-bot

Base code for building WebEx Teams Bot hosted inside G suite using Google App Script (JavaScript).


## Business/Technical Challenge

We often hear that when creating simple WebEx teams bots, where to host the code and how to make it accessible can be slow down projects before they even get started. In today's world everybody has a google account. The goal is to show hoe easy it is to host the code inside of a google document. We'll show that google sheets can be a very workable database for your code along with hosting the application itself. As well, one of our peers created an awesome polling tool, but the tool died when he left Cisco, so why not rebuild it.

## Proposed Solution

We were inspired by [this article on building a Viber bot without code](https://developers.viber.com/blog/2017/09/12/build-a-bot-with-zero-coding) and want to take what [Itamar Mula](https://github.com/ItamarM) created and bring it to Webex Teams. For some this will be a simple poll bot they can use, but for others this will be the base of how to host a bot inside a g-suite document. Stretch goals include taking it further turning the first bot into a live polling tool that might be a simple version of what [Kahoot](https://getkahoot.com/) or [Poll Everywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com/) do (using Google Slides). Beyond that, once buttons and cards come to Webex Teams we'll want to have those as ways for people to respond to polls.
